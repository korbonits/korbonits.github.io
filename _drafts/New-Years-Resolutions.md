## Hold me accountable

This year, I propose the following set of New Years Resolutions. I am posting this subset of my goals publically so you can hold me accountable. I'll do a retrospective at the end of 2018, and try to keep this list updated with progress throughout the year. I'm using Trello to keep track in real time.

## Reading

- Read 50 books/15,000-20,000 pages (tracking with Goodreads)
- Read year 1 of the 10 year reading plan of Great Books of the Western World
- Read all papers in Microsoft Research's "Paper Legend: Artificial Intelligence Edition" card game

This year I am going to change it up in terms of my reading goals. Last year I took an ambitious goal of reading 50 books. By Google OKR standards, I hit 76%, which is quite a success! I liked this goal because it was easy to track and kept me motivated throughout the year. I may have hit 50 had I spent the first half of 2017 on-target, second, I spent about a month without finishing a book in Q4 as I transitioned from one job to another.

"Number of books read" is not the best metric, in my opinion. War and Peace != Hamlet. This metric is easy to game by reading smaller books. I remember making some tradeoffs this fall where, trying to select a next book to read, I looked for the shortest book in my library I hadn't read yet. Essentially, this metric penalizes you for reading longer works and rewards you for reading shorter works.

"Number of pages read", a metric that Goodreads shows (based on the public information about the books you shelve), is much better for comparing War and Peace with Hamlet. In 2017, I read (i.e., finished) 38 books. This turns out to be about 14,500 pages according to Goodreads. That's about 382 pages/book and a reading pace of about 40 pages/day. This metric is still not perfect, however. It doesn't take into account the heterogeneity of writing styles and, perhaps more importantly, speed of comprehension. For example, some contemporary writing reads so well it could be a movie screenplay. Some books, like Ready Player One, are captivating page turners that one can read in a single sitting. However, some books, like a mathematics textbook (with proofs) or philosophy, read much, much slower. One of the reasons I find fiction so easy to read is that by suspending disbelief it's easy to get sucked in and follow along in a very immersive way. One *could* do a close reading of any fiction and spend much more time dissecting it, but for pure entertainment, it's easy to proceed quickly. Reading math, philosophy, or scientific papers is much more demanding on the reader. Not only is the information contained in these formats much higher in terms of density (e.g., mathematical notation), but following the logic is intrinsically a very demanding task. Reading in these formats is highly non-linear (in terms of progressing from beginning to end). One is constantly looking up terms, searching in indices, reading cited papers, re-reading paragraphs, stopping to think, etc. "Number of pages" is still not the perfect metric for measuring reading.

What's a perfect metric? I'm not really sure. I think a metric along the lines of "elapsed time reading in a flow-like state" is probably a democratic one. That's harder to track unless you make tracking it a very strong habit. For 2018, I think I'll stick to number of books read as a high-level proxy and formulate multiple reading subgoals to round things out.

### The Great Books, Year 1

One of my reading sub-goals in 2018 is to start systematically attacking my copy of the Great Books. In volume 1, "The Great Conversation", there's a 10 year reading plan laid out by the main editors, Robert Maynard Hutchins and Mortimer Adler. I've read many of the works suggested for the first year before but I will willingly re-read them. 

Here is the recommended reading list for year one of the Great Books:

- Plato: Apology, Crito
- Aristophanies: Clouds, Lysistrata
- Plato: Republic [Book I, II]
- Aristotle Ethics [Book I]
- Aristotle Politics [Book I]
- Plutarch: Lycurgus, Numa Pompilius, Lycurgus and Numa compared, Alexander, Caesar
- New Testament [Matthew & Acts of Apostles]
- St. Augustine: Confessions [Books I-VIII]
- Machiavelli: The Prince
- Rabelais: Gargantua and Pantagruel [Book I-II]
- Montaigne: Essays [Of Custom, and That We should not easily change a law received; of pedantry; of the education of children; that it is folly to measure truth and error by our own capacity; of cannibals; that the relish of good and evil depends in a great measure upon the opinion we have of them; upon some verses of virgil
- Hamlet
- Locke: Concerning Civil Government [Second Essay]
- Rousseau: The Social Contract [Book I-II]
- Gibbon: The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire [Ch. 15-16]
- The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, The Federalist [Nos. 1-10, 15, 31, 47, 51, 68-71]
- Smith: The Wealth of Nations [Introduction-Book I, Ch. 9]
- Marx-Engels: Manifesto of the Communist Party

## Writing

In 2018, I am going to take on writing goals. Here's my list:

- Blogging: >= 12 blog posts (1x/month)
- Speaking: >= 1 public speaking event (under writing because it's putting together a talk)
- NIPS workshop submission (this is pretty ambitious, I need to scope)
- Music composition (string quartet -- likely a single movement), to be premiered for my 30th birthday.

I think that I would like to do some other writing-related things like successfully contribute to an open source software project or begin to write a book, but those need more scoping before I could take such goals on. 

One of the best things I did in 2017 was attend NIPS. I am inspired by all of the brilliant research occuring in machine learning and I want to contribute. I think if I had to pick a workshop to contribute to this year it would be for the creativity workshop. I think a workshop submission would be a great gateway for a 2019+ goal of successfully submitting and being chosen as part of the NIPS conference proceedings. I 

## Travel

This year I will be heading back to Paris for the first time since I was 17. I'd like to bone up on my French, which is rusty as of 2006, and I'd like to visit a new country.

- Visit >= 1 new country
- Practice French

## Fitness

As I enter a new decade of life, I want to add a focus on physical fitness. In 2017 I started regularly working with a personal trainer and it has been a great start to being fit. That being said, it isn't enough. I need to take some attainable yet challenging and measurable goals. Challenging especially if I fall behind (see running goal).

- Personal training 1x/week
- Lifting 1x/week (in addition to training)
- Go sailing >= 1x/month
- Enter >= 1 sailboat race
- Run a 5k race (I have subgoals to get to this)
- Run 365 miles in 2018 (>= 1 mile/day)
- Lose 10 lbs., sustainably
- Do yoga >= 1 in January and go from there
- Climb Mt. Pilchuk

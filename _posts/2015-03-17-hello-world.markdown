Hello, World!

This is my inaugural blog post on my newly-created personal website. You can find the code [here][korbonits-github-io].

One thing I'd like to get out of the experience of managing the code and creating meaningful posts for this blog is knowledge.

I intend to use this blog as a personal platform for learning and sharing my insights. There will be links to github repos; there will be links to source material.

I should probably created a blogroll and figure out what the best practices are for citing sources within posts (bibli*blog*raphy?).

Note that this blog is hosted by [GitHub Pages][github-pages], and is built using [Jekyll][jekyll].

Those who know my love of [Python][python] may be surprised.

My LinkedIn [profile][linkedin] is a great place to see a quick summary of my educational, professional, and volunteering background.

Here's my twitter [profile][twitter], probably the place I post the most. This is a personal account, but is a reliable chronicle of the kinds of intellectual problems I'm actively thinking about, learning about, and working on. Interesting to see in my tweets/retweets the intersection of culture and professional development from a time when I aspired to be a patent attorney (c. 2009) to the present (c. 2015), where I aspire to be an expert in applying methods in deep learning to real-world problems.

<p><strike>This is my first website!</strike> <em>Not true</em>, actually.</p>

Does anyone remember [AngelFire][angelfire] websites? Back in the *day*, one of my friends and I built two small-ish websites (unfortunately, I can't find them). We must have been in the 4th grade because that was the year when both [Goldeneye][goldeneye] and [Ocarina of Time][zelda] came out on [N64][n64] (linked in case you're too young to know what that is). We started building walkthroughs.

This is my first *real* website, built from scratch (harnessing [Jekyll][jekyll] and [GitHub Pages][github-pages]), and where I talk about things *other* than N64 games... most of the time, anyway.
